    "item_1": "Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nOn September 1, 2020, Tesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d) entered into an equity distribution agreement (the \u201cEquity Distribution Agreement\u201d) with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, SG Americas Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., as sales agents (each, a \u201cSales Agent\u201d and collectively, the \u201cSales Agents\u201d), to sell shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Tesla (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d) having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $5.0 billion (the \u201cShares\u201d), from time to time, through an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering program (the \u201cOffering\u201d).\nUpon delivery of a placement notice and subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Sales Agents will use reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations, and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market to sell the Shares from time to time based upon Tesla\u2019s instructions for the sales, including any price, time or size limits specified by Tesla. Under the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Sales Agents may sell the Shares by any method permitted by law, including in ordinary brokers\u2019 transactions, in negotiated transactions, in block trades, and in transactions that are deemed to be an \u201cat-the-market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The Sales Agents\u2019 obligations to sell the Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including customary closing conditions.\nThe Equity Distribution Agreement provides that the Sales Agents will be entitled to compensation for their services in the form of a commission of up to 0.50% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of the Shares, and Tesla has agreed to reimburse the Sales Agents for certain specified expenses. Tesla has also agreed to provide the Sales Agents with customary indemnification and contribution rights. Tesla is not obligated to sell any Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Equity Distribution Agreement. The Equity Distribution Agreement may be terminated by Tesla at any time by giving written notice to the Sales Agents for any reason or by each Sales Agent at any time, with respect to such Sales Agent only, by giving written notice to Tesla for any reason or immediately under certain circumstances, including but not limited to the occurrence of a material adverse change in the company. The Offering of the Shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Equity Distribution Agreement by Tesla or the Sales Agents.\nThe sales and issuances of the Shares under the Equity Distribution Agreement will be made pursuant to Tesla\u2019s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-231168) (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on May 2, 2019. On the date hereof, Tesla intends to file a prospectus supplement with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nThe foregoing description of the Equity Distribution Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThis Current Report on Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities under the Equity Distribution Agreement, nor shall there be any sale of such securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nVehicle Lease Warehouse Credit Facilities\nIn order to support Tesla\u2019s direct vehicle leasing program, Tesla\u2019s subsidiaries from time to time establish warehouse credit facilities where Tesla is not a guarantor or otherwise a party. As previously reported, (i) Tesla Finance LLC (\u201cTFL\u201d) and Tesla 2014 Warehouse SPV LLC are parties to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated August 17, 2017, with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch (\u201cDB\u201d) as administrative agent and the other parties thereto (as amended, the \u201cA&R Warehouse Agreement\u201d), and (ii) TFL and LML 2018\nWarehouse SPV, LLC, an indirect Tesla subsidiary, were parties to a separate Loan and Security Agreement, dated December 28, 2018, with DB as administrative agent and the other parties thereto (as amended, the \u201c2018 Warehouse Agreement\u201d).\nOn August 28, 2020:\n\u2022\nThe 2018 Warehouse Agreement was terminated following the payment in full of all obligations thereunder as a result of a securitization of the leased vehicle assets collateralizing the 2018 Warehouse Agreement; and\n\u2022\nThe A&R Warehouse Agreement was further amended and restated to, among other things, reflect the termination of the 2018 Warehouse Agreement and to extend the borrowing availability date to August 13, 2021 and extend the maturity date to September 2022.\nAs so amended, the A&R Warehouse Agreement has an aggregate lender commitment of $1.1 billion, the same amount as the aggregate lender commitment previously shared by the A&R Warehouse Agreement and the 2018 Warehouse Agreement prior to the termination of the latter.\nThe foregoing description of the A&R Warehouse Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2020.\nItem 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.\nThe information set forth in Item 1.01 above under the heading \u201cVehicle Lease Warehouse Credit Facilities\u201d is incorporated herein by reference.",
