(\u201cActivision Blizzard\u201d) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with Activision Blizzard surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft, Microsoft has commenced offers to exchange (each, an \u201cExchange Offer\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cExchange Offers\u201d) any and all outstanding notes issued by Activision Blizzard (the \u201cExisting Activision Blizzard Notes\u201d) for (1) up to $3,650,000,000 aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by Microsoft (the \u201cNew Microsoft Notes\u201d) and (2) cash. Concurrently with the Exchange Offers being made by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard is, upon Microsoft\u2019s request, soliciting consents (each, a \u201cConsent Solicitation\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cConsent Solicitations\u201d) to adopt certain proposed amendments to each of the corresponding indentures governing the Existing Activision Blizzard Notes to eliminate certain of the covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default from such indentures.\nEach Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is conditioned upon the completion of the other Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, although Microsoft may waive such condition at any time with respect to an Exchange Offer.\nThe New Microsoft Notes have not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or any state or foreign securities laws. Therefore, the New Microsoft Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. person absent registration, except pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.\nThe Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are being made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement dated as of October 16, 2023 (as it may be amended or supplemented, the \u201cOffering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement\u201d). A copy of the press release announcing the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe information in this Item 8.01, as well as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished, not filed.
