(\u201cTesla\u201d) since 2008. Mr. Ahuja will continue in his role as Tesla\u2019s Chief Financial Officer for a brief period and thereafter intends to continue to serve as an advisor to Tesla to ensure a smooth transition.\nTesla also announced that upon Mr. Ahuja\u2019s retirement, Tesla intends to appoint Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla\u2019s current Vice President, Finance, Financial Planning and Business Operations, to replace Mr. Ahuja as Tesla\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kirkhorn joined Tesla in March 2010 to lead cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency efforts for the Tesla Roadster. He has since played critical roles in the development and execution of a number of major programs, including site selection and launch of Gigafactory 1 and the launches and ramps of Model X and Model 3.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Deepak for his tremendous contributions to Tesla,\u201d said Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cZach has been with Tesla for nine years, and he is incredibly talented and very well-known and respected among the Tesla team. We\u2019re looking forward to him serving in his new role as CFO.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very inspired by Elon and the entire Tesla team. People here are brilliant, very passionate about the company\u2019s mission and more driven than I have seen anywhere else,\u201d said Mr. Ahuja. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to leave, but Tesla has now had two great quarters of profitability, and cash flow generation, which puts the company on a much more solid financial foundation to achieve future successes. I\u2019m very confident in Zach\u2019s leadership, and I\u2019ve seen firsthand how he has proven himself over the years.\u201d\n\u201cI joined Tesla because I was so attracted to the company\u2019s mission and vision,\u201d said Mr. Kirkhorn. \u201cWe\u2019re starting 2019 in a very strong financial position, and my focus is on continuing our momentum on cost management and operational efficiency so that we can get our products to more people and ultimately help us achieve our mission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\nTESLA, INC.\nBy:\n/s/ Dane Butswinkas\nDane Butswinkas\nGeneral Counsel\nDate: January 31, 2019"
